<h1>Data science Portfolio by Umair Qadir&nbsp;</h1>
<p>This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and other Gitub Repositories which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.</p>
<h2>Stand-alone projects.</h2>
<h3>Handwritten digit recognition</h3>
<p>This is my own project using image recognition methods in practice. This is a site (also works on mobile) where user can draw a digit, and machine learning models (FNN and CNN) will try to recognize it. After than models can use the drawn digit for training to improve their accuracy. Live version is&nbsp;<a href="https://digits-draw-recognize.herokuapp.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. The code can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/digit-draw-recognize">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Classification problems.</h2>
<h3>Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb">Github</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Titanic.ipynb" rel="nofollow">nbviewer</a></p>
<p>Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic" rel="nofollow">Kaggle</a>. Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.</p>
<h3>Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/GGG.ipynb">Github</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/GGG.ipynb" rel="nofollow">nbviewer</a></p>
<p>Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo! is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem: based on information about monsters we predict their types. A fun competition for Halloween. General description and data are available on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo" rel="nofollow">Kaggle</a>. This dataset has little number of samples, so careful feature selection and model ensemble are necessary for high accuracy.</p>
<h3>Otto Group Product Classification Challenge</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Otto_Group.ipynb">Github</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Otto_Group.ipynb" rel="nofollow">nbviewer</a></p>
<p>Otto Group Product Classification Challenge is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. This is a multiple classification problem. Based on information about products we predict their category. General description and data are available on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge" rel="nofollow">Kaggle</a>. The data is obfuscated, so the main questionlies in the selection of the model for prediction.</p>
<h3>Imbalanced classes</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Imbalanced.ipynb">Github</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Imbalanced.ipynb" rel="nofollow">nbviewer</a></p>
<p>In real world it is common to meet data in which some classes are more common and others are rarer. In case of a serious disbalance prediction rare classes could be difficult using standard classification methods. In this notebook I analyse such a situation. I can't share the data, used in this analysis.</p>
<h3>Bank card activations</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Card_activation.ipynb">Github</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/Card_activation.ipynb" rel="nofollow">nbviewer</a></p>
<p>Banks strive to increase the efficiency of their contacts with customers. One of the areas which require this is offering new products to existing clients (cross-selling). Instead of offering new products to all clients, it is a good idea to predict the probability of a positive response. Then the offers could be sent to those clients, for whom the probability of response is higher than some threshold value. In this notebook I try to solve this problem.</p>

<h2>Regression problems.</h2>
<h3>House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/House_Prices.ipynb">Github</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Erlemar/Erlemar.github.io/blob/master/Notebooks/House_Prices.ipynb" rel="nofollow">nbviewer</a></p>
